# Earthquake Data Analysis in Rust

This repository contains a Rust-based implementation for analyzing earthquake data.  The primary goal is to fetch earthquake data,extract meaningful insights, such as temporal trends and geographical distribution, and add asynchronocity with tokio and observability with Open Telemetry.

## Features

- **Fetching Data**: fetch/src
- **Fetching Data Asyncronously**: process_async/src
- **Data Analysis with Rust**: process_async/src
- **Adding Observability with Telemetry**: process_async_opentelemetry/src
